# What is Minishell?

Minishell is a project of 42 networks cursus that's going to allow you to re-code a small-shell or a small-command interpreter that has the same behaviour as the BASH. In fact, this command interpreter is obliged to be done by a team of 2 developers and of course you can split up the work as you wish.
