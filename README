* Minishell
Minishell is a lightweight shell program built with C that mimics the functionality of the Bash shell. It provides users with a command-line interface for executing various commands and managing processes.

Features
Command execution: Execute built-in shell commands and external programs.
Redirection: Redirect input and output streams using redirection operators.
Pipelines: Create pipelines to connect the output of one command to the input of another.
Environment variables: Manage environment variables and access their values.
Signal handling: Handle signals such as SIGINT (Ctrl+C) and SIGQUIT (Ctrl+).
Getting Started
To compile and run Minishell on your system, follow these steps:

Clone the Minishell repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the make command to compile the source code.
Execute the compiled minishell binary to start the shell.
Usage
Once Minishell is running, you can use it just like any other shell program. Here are some basic usage examples:

Run built-in shell commands such as cd, echo, and exit.
Execute external programs by typing their names followed by any arguments.
Use redirection operators (>, <, >>) to manage input and output streams.
Create pipelines using the | symbol to chain multiple commands together.
